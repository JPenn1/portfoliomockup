[N] [!] mobile-first design

Following the workflow of mobile-first design is a requirement for all Thinkful projects.

In mobile-first, our default styling is for mobile. We then use min-width to override small bits of the mobile styling for larger screens.

The general CSS layout will look as follows (notice the user of min-width as opposed to max-width):

body {
    /* default styles here, 
       targets mobile first */
}

@media screen and (min-width:480px) {
  body {
    /* style changes when the screen gets larger */
  }
}

@media screen and (min-width:800px) {
  body {
     /* And even larger */
  }
[N] [!] semantic, valid markup
You have some validation errors in your markup. I recommend running your code through the W3C HTML Validator. Warnings are OK, but errors should be resolved. See: https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjpenn1.github.io%2Fportfoliomockup%2F%23home.
